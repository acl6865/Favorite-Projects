Working in a group of four, friends and I created a tabletop roleplaying game from scratch. The challenges 
we attempted to address in our project were to not use d20s (twenty-sided die) and address the issue of having stagnant characters 
in a multi-session long campaign. Our solution to the former was to simply use other dice while the latter was addressed 
by playing not as a single character but rather that character and their descendants. We spent a semester of school iterating on 
deigns and working through our project to yield this final product. The entire rules for the game are published and free 
to download at the below link:
